## Running the Note-Taking Application

To run your note-taking application, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt**.
2. **Navigate to the project directory** where your `src` folder is located. For example, if your project is named `note_taking_app`, use the following command:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/note_taking_app/src
   ```

   Replace `path/to/note_taking_app` with the actual path to your project.

3. **Run the application** using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   If you're on macOS or Linux, and you need to use Python 3, you might need to run:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

### Summary
So the full command sequence looks like this:

```bash
cd path/to/note_taking_app/src
python main.py
```

This will start your note-taking application, and you will be able to interact with it through the command line.
